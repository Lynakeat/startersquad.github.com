          <h2>Technical Feasibility Scan</h2>

          <p>
            A solid technical fundament is crucial for sustainable success of Internet Startups. To mitigate technical
            implementation risk StarterSquad can perform a Technical Feasibility Scan. We will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>draw up a potential architecture;</li>
            <li>estimate the amount of work [1];</li>
            <li>identify technical risks such as: scalability, complexity or need for rare skills.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When investing in a new idea, there are business risks and technical risks. Financial investors ask founders
            to scrutinize the business risks, but most technical investors [2] are less experienced and fooled by the
            founders' enthusiasm. An investor should not rely on the founders’ technical team to identify risks early.

          <h2>Business Viability Scan</h2>

          <p>
            StarterSquad has developed a methodology for scanning the viability of your startup or innovation idea. In
            our evidence-based approach we check your startup against 7 dimensions of successful Startups:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Idea: the idea is superb and will make headlines instantly.</li>
            <li>Team: your team is awesome and will make this idea happen.</li>
            <li>Product: your product just rocks your customers’ socks off!</li>
            <li>Market: there is a big and identifiable market for your idea.</li>
            <li>Execution: the power to realize your dream both technically and commercially.</li>
            <li>Traction: the proof that your value proposition is appealing to customers.</li>
            <li>Social Proof: the proof that investors are interested and comparable startups are in business.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Business Viability Scan consists of a questionnaire, desk research and 2 workshops with your Startup
            team. It results in a report that can be used for growing your business and acquiring investment. This scan
            is often combined with the Technical Feasibility Scan when it comes technology-based Startups. Together they
            provide a roadmap for Lean Startup of your Business.

          <h2>Investor Readiness Check</h2>
          <p>In order to convince investors and banks to fund your Startup you need some solid preparation. The
            Startersquad Investor Readiness Check helps you to address flaws and boost the unique characteristics of
            your Startup idea. Based upon our Technical Feasibility Scan and Business Viability Scan we can perform a
            two-day Investor Readiness Check delivering great value. In the Investor Readiness Scan we cover the
            following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Startup Idea Strenghts: we will scrutinize your Startup idea to find strengths and weaknesses from an
              investor’s perspective. This will lead to some homework that needs to be done for the second day.
            </li>
            <li>Risks & Measures: experienced StarterSquad members will help you to fine-tune risks and measures for
              your
              Startup. We’ll find critical assumptions that need to be tested and define measures for risk management.
            </li>
            <li>Financing Options: we will provide you with financing options for your Startup and point you in the
              direction where investment for your specific idea can be found.
            </li>
            <li>Pitch Deck & Skills: finally we will spend some time on your pitch. Both the content (deck) and your
              skills
              pitching will be addressed.
            </li>
          </ul>
