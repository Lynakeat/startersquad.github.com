    Research results and opinions on team performance come in great variation. They agree on one point: building a high
    performance team takes time and effort. We have such a team, we know our strengths and weaknesses and we can focus
    on delivering value from day one. In addition, we have the skills to build such a team. We can repeat the process
    for any startup. So you start with a team at full speed and then, as you grow, add and replace people until the team consist of
    your own employees.

    In a StarterSquad team learning and feedback are valued highly. We make time to teach each other new tricks and that
    pays off. It pays off in terms of speed and predictability. It pays off in terms of quality and reliability. But most
    importantly it pays off in terms of the pleasure with which we do our daily job.
